# PixelGrid
PixelGrid is a versatile web tool offering insights into any content rendered on the HTML canvas. Through its custom-built `pixel-grid` HTML element, users can observe and extract individual pixel data, including RGB values.

## **Key Features:**

- **Canvas Compatibility**: Supports all types of content, from videos to sketches.
- **Pixel Insights**: Real-time monitoring and extraction of RGB values.
- **Data Conversion**: Transition between 2D arrays and 3D matrices.
- **Extensible**: Integration-ready for larger web projects or standalone use.

Overall, this class provides the core functionalities needed for a grid of pixels, with methods to access, modify, and visualize pixel data.

## Installation
```bash
npm i this.pixelgrid
```

### Introduction

PixelGrid provides an interface for HTML5 canvas pixel manipulation. It can function as a standalone module in a Node.js environment, as a web component in HTML files, or in a headless environment.

**Responsibility:** Display pixels and provide basic interactions with them.
It's a visual component that could be utilized by other modules or functionalities.
High-level operations on pixels, source management (like webcam feed), processing, transformations, and other functionalities.
Utilizes the PixelGrid for visual representation and feedback but is not limited by it.

PixelGrid defaults to if no width and heights specified.

```js
this.width = this.getAttribute('width') || 300;
this.height = this.getAttribute('height') || 150;
```

#### **How to use:**
- Direct Web Component:

  ```html
  <script src="./PixelGrid.js" defer></script>
  <pixel-grid id="pg" width="640" height="480"></pixel-grid>
  ```

- With `this.pixel` for extended functionality:

  ```javascript
  npm install this.pixel
  const PixelGrid = require('this.pixel');
  ```

Use the attribute in your HTML:
If you want the canvas to be optimized for frequent reads:

```html
<pixel-grid will-read-frequently="true"></pixel-grid>
```

If you don't want to optimize for frequent reads:

```html
<pixel-grid></pixel-grid>
```

Or:

```html
<pixel-grid will-read-frequently="false"></pixel-grid>
```



## Standardizing Web Elements for Machine Learning

The **this.** modules aim to transform traditional web elements into standardized formats ready for machine learning.

### Principles Behind the this. Library:

- **Abstraction for ML**: Structure web content for machine learning.
- **Web Standards**: Relies on familiar public web standards.
- **Open and Collaborative**: Leveraging public standards for community collaboration.
